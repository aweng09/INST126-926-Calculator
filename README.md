# INST126-926-Calculator
A calculator project completed for the first unit of the INST126 course at UMD.

## Introduction
This calculator performs four main functions - addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division - as decided by the input of the user. Users may perform operations with more than two numbers at a time. Other features include the ability to save an answer to use in the next iteration of functions, and the continuity of the program after one operation has been performed.

## Installation
Prerequisites for running the program include either JuptyerLab, with which it was made. Simply run the ipynb file in JupyterLab.

## Troubleshooting
Please keep in mind that as the files were created in JupyterLab, individual cells are not affected by common commands like "quit" or "exit," and therefore implementation of try-catches to prevent TypeErrors based on user input could not be done. Therefore, users should remember to enter inputs as specifically noted within the program.

(TLDR: If you run into a TypeError, it's probably because you entered a string instead of an integer, you silly goose)
